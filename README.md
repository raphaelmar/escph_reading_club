# European School of Copenhagen Reading club

The European School of Copenhagen is a multicultural and multilingual school, where students are encouraged to develop skills that allow them to thrive in a diverse environment by promoting their use of languages. Reading is an essential part of this process. The aim of the Reading Club is to provide students with a place where they can share a review of their favourite stories with their peers and can search for new reading ideas based on their peers' positive experience. The site is in English as it is the official communication language of the shcool, but the reviews and the reviewed books can be in the language of their choice, the other official languages of the school being French, German and Danish. 

## UX

The Reading club is aimed at students who are independent readers and who are able to write a concise book review, aged 10 to 18. Visually, the site re-uses the colour code that is used by the school's main website https://europaskolen.sag.dk/ - automatic ! [Europaskolen](https://europaskolen.sag.dk/). It is simple, clear and clutter free, focusing on the main element that are the review cards.

### User stories

As a user of the of the Reading club:
* I can enter the basic details of the book I have read (title, author, language, genre) so that it can be easily identified by other users.
* I can write a review of the book I have enjoyed so that it is shared with other users and they are encouraged to read the book through my review.
* I can edit and delete my own reviews so that I can amend any mistakes or completely remove a review if I do not want it on the Club any longer.
* I can read other users' reviews so that I can discover new stories and be encouraged to read them. 
* I can "like" other users' reviews to express my appreciation of the review and/or the book reviewed.
* I can search the bank of reviews using keywords if I am looking for something in particular (books in French only for example).
* I can be a registered user and log in if I want to write and publish my own reviews or I can be a non-registered user if I just want to read reviews and "like" them.
